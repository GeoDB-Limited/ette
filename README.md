## Inspiration 🤔

I was looking for one tool which will be able to keep itself in sync with latest happenings on EVM based blockchain i.e. index blockchain data, while exposing REST & GraphQL API for querying blockchain data with various filters. That tool will also expose real time notification functionalities over websocket, when subscribed to topics.

It's not that I was unable find any solution, but wasn't fully satisfied with those, so I decided to write `ette`, which will do following

- Sync upto latest state of blockchain
- Listen for all happenings on EVM based blockchain
- Persist all happenings in local database
- Expose REST & GraphQL API for querying 👇, while also setting block range/ time range for filtering results. Allow querying latest **X** entries for events emitted by contracts.
    - Block data
    - Transaction data
    - Event data

- Expose websocket based real time notification mechanism for 
    - Blocks being mined
    - Transactions being sent from address and/ or transactions being received at address
    - Events being emitted by contract, with indexed fields i.e. topics

- All historical data query requests must carry authentication header as `APIKey`, which can be generated by users, using webUI, packed with `ette`.
- All real-time event subscription & unsubscription requests must carry `apiKey` in their payload.
- It has very minimalistic webUI for creating & managing `APIKey`(s).

And that's `ette`

## Prerequisite 👍

- Make sure you've Go _( >= 1.15 )_ installed
- You need to also install & set up PostgreSQL. I found [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-postgresql-on-ubuntu-20-04) guide helpful.
- Redis needs to be installed too. Consider following [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-secure-redis-on-ubuntu-20-04) guide.

> Note : Redis **v6.0.6** is required

> Note : Setting password in Redis instance has been made optional from now on, though it's recommended.

- Blockchain Node's both **HTTP & Websocket** connection URL required, because we'll be querying block, transaction, event log related data using HTTP interface & listening for block mining events in real time over Websocket.

## Installation 🛠

- First fork this repository & clone it, some where out side of **GOPATH**.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:username/ette.git
```

- Now get inside `ette`

```bash
cd ette
```

- Create a `.env` file in this directory. 

    - Make sure PostgreSQL has md5 authentication mechanism enabled.
    - Please enable password based authentication in Redis Server.
    - `Admin` is ethereum address who will be able to administer `ette` using webUI. _[ **This feature is not yet implemented, but please put `Admin` in config file** ]_
    - Replace `Domain` with your domain name i.e. `ette.company.com`
    - Set `Production` to `yes` before running it in production; otherwise you can simply skip it
    - `ette` can be run in any of 3 possible modes, which can be set by `EtteMode`

    ```json
    {
        "1": "Only Historical Data Query Allowed",
        "2": "Only Real-time Event Subscription Allowed",
        "3": "Both Historical Data Query & Real-time Event Subscription Allowed"
    }
    ```

    - For testing historical data query using browser based GraphQL Playground in `ette`, you can set `EtteGraphQLPlayGround` to `yes` in config file
    - For processing block(s)/ tx(s) concurrently, it'll create `ConcurrencyFactor * #-of CPUs on machine` workers, who will pick up jobs submitted to them.
    - If nothing is specified, it defaults to 1 & assuming you're running `ette` on machine with 4 CPUs, it'll spawn worker pool of size 4. But more number of jobs can be submitted, only 4 can be running at max.
    - 👆 being done for controlling concurrency level, by putting more control on user's hand.
    - If you want to persist blocks in delayed fashion, you might consider setting `BlockConfirmations` to some _number > 0_.
    - That will make `ette` think you're asking it 80 is latest block, which can be persisted in final data store, when latest mined block number is 100 & `BlockConfirmations` is set to 20.
    - This option is **recommended** to be used, at least in production.
    - Skipping `RedisPassword` is absolutely fine, if you don't want to use any password in Redis instance. [ **Not recommended** ]
    - For range based queries `BlockRange` can be set to limit how many blocks can be queried by client in a single go. Default value 100.
    - For time span based queries `TimeRange` can be set to put limit on max time span _( in terms of second )_, can be used by clients. Default value 3600 i.e. 1 hour.

```
RPCUrl=https://<domain-name>
WebsocketUrl=wss://<domain-name>
PORT=7000
DB_USER=user
DB_PASSWORD=password
DB_HOST=x.x.x.x
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=ette
RedisConnection=tcp
RedisAddress=x.x.x.x:6379
RedisPassword=password
Admin=e19b9EB3Bf05F1C8100C9b6E8a3D8A14F6384BFb
Domain=localhost
Production=yes
EtteMode=3
EtteGraphQLPlayGround=yes
ConcurrencyFactor=2
BlockConfirmations=20
BlockRange=1000
TimeRange=21600
```

- Create another file in same directory, named `.plans.json`, whose content will look like 👇.

    - This file holds subscription plans for clients, allowed by this `ette` instance.
    - Each plan is denoted by one unique `name` & `deliveryCount`, where _`deliveryCount` denotes number of times data to be delivered to client application in 24 hours of time span._
    - Because each request must be accompanied with `APIKey`, `ette` knows which user is requesting for resources & how many were delivered successfully in last 24 hours of time span.
    - If one user crosses allowed request limit in 24 hours, no new request will be taken under consideration & any existing connection will stop delivering data to client.

> **Quick Tip :** Setting `deliveryCount` is fully upto you. Please consider VM specifications before doing so.

```json
{
    "plans": [
        {
            "name": "TIER 1",
            "deliveryCount": 50000
        },
        {
            "name": "TIER 2",
            "deliveryCount": 100000
        },
        {
            "name": "TIER 3",
            "deliveryCount": 500000
        },
        {
            "name": "TIER 4",
            "deliveryCount": 750000
        },
        {
            "name": "TIER 5",
            "deliveryCount": 1000000
        }
    ]
}
```

- Now build `ette`

```bash
go build
```

- If everything goes as expected, you'll find one binary named, **ette** in this directory. Run it. 

```bash
./ette
```

- Database migration to be taken care of during application start up.
- Syncing `ette` with latest state of blockchain takes time. Current sync state can be queried

```bash
curl -s localhost:7000/v1/synced | jq
```

- You'll receive response of form 👇

```json
{
  "elapsed": "3m2.487237s",
  "eta": "87h51m38s",
  "processed": 4242,
  "synced": "0.35 %"
}
```

> Note: For production, you'll most probably run it using `systemd`

## Use Cases 🤯

`ette` is supposed to be deployed by anyone, interested in running a historical data query & real-time notification service for EVM-based blockchain(s).

All client requests are rate limited _( 50k requests/ day )_. This rate limit is enforced on all `APIKey`(s) created by any single Ethereum Address. You can create multiple `APIKey`(s) from your account & accumulated requests made from those keys to be considered before dropping your requests.

> So, it'll be helpful for protecting from spam attacks.

**More features coming here, soon**

## Management using webUI 🖥

`ette` has one minimalistic webUI for generating & managing `APIKey`(s). It doesn't have any password based login mechanism. You need to have [Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) browser plugin installed for logging into `ette` management webUI.

Once you've started `ette` on your machine, open browser & head to [http://localhost:7000/v1/login](http://localhost:7000/v1/login).

You'll be greeted with 👇

![ui](./sc/login_1.png)

Assuming you've Metamask browser plugin installed, you can click `Login` & you'll be asked to sign a message of specific format, which will be validated by `ette`.

![ui](./sc/login_2.png)

Once logged in, you can find out all `APIKey`(s) created by you.

![ui](./sc/webUI_1.png)

If you've not any `APIKey`(s) created yet, go ahead & click `Create new app`. Again you'll be asked to sign a message of specific format.

![ui](./sc/webUI_2.png)

And you'll see new `APIKey` on your screen.

![ui](./sc/webUI_3.png)

You can create any number of `APIKey`(s), but rate limiting to be applied on aggregated requests from all those `APIKey`(s).

> Now go ahead & use `APIKey` in header of historical data query requests/ payload of real-time notification subscription/ unsubscription request.

**Double clicking on created `APIKey` toggles its enabled state, which is represented visually.** 👇

![ui](./sc/webUI.gif)

Enabled | Text Color
--- | ---
Yes | Green
No | Red

> **Quick Tip:** As you can create any number of `APIKey`(s) from one Ethereum address, if you feel any of those has been exposed, disabling those ensures all requests accompanied with those `APIKey`(s) to be dropped, by `ette`

## Usage 🦾

`ette` exposes REST & GraphQL API for querying historical block, transaction & event related data. It can also play role of real time notification engine, when subscribed to supported topics.

> **_All historical data query requests need to be strictly accompanied with valid `APIKey` as request header param_** 🤖

### Real time notification for mined blocks ⛏

For listening to blocks getting mined, connect to `/v1/ws` endpoint using websocket client library & once connected, you need to send **subscription** request with 👇 payload _( JSON encoded )_

```json
{
    "name": "block",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

If everything goes fine, your subscription will be confirmed with 👇 response _( JSON encoded )_

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Subscribed to `block`"
}
```

After that as long as your machine is reachable, `ette` will keep notifying you about new blocks getting mined in 👇 form

```json
{
  "hash": "0x08f50b4795667528f6c0fdda31a0d270aae60dbe7bc4ea950ae1f71aaa01eabc",

}
```

If you want to cancel subscription, consider sending 👇

```json
{
    "name": "block",
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

You'll receive 👇 response, confirming unsubscription

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Unsubscribed from `block`"
}
```

> Sample code can be found [here](example/block.js)

### Real time notification for transactions ⚡️

For listening to any transaction happening in network in real-time, send 👇 JSON encoded payload to `/v1/ws`

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/<from-address>/<to-address>",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

**Here we've some examples :**

- Any transaction

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/*/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

> Sample Code can be found [here](example/transaction_1.js)

- Fixed `from` field **[ tx originated `from` account ]**

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/0x4774fEd3f2838f504006BE53155cA9cbDDEe9f0c/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

> Sample Code can be found [here](example/transaction_2.js)

- Fixed `to` field **[ tx targeted `to` account ]**

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/*/0x4774fEd3f2838f504006BE53155cA9cbDDEe9f0c",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

> Sample Code can be found [here](example/transaction_3.js)

- Fixed `from` & `to` field **[ tx `from` -> `to` account ]**

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/0xc9D50e0a571aDd06C7D5f1452DcE2F523FB711a1/0x4774fEd3f2838f504006BE53155cA9cbDDEe9f0c",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

> Sample Code can be found [here](example/transaction_4.js)

If everything goes fine, your subscription will be confirmed with 👇 response _( JSON encoded )_

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Subscribed to `transaction`",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

After that as long as your machine is reachable, `ette` will keep notifying you about every transaction happening in 👇 form, where criterias matching

```json
{
  "hash": "0x08cfda79bd68ad280c7786e5dd349ab81981c52ea5cdd8e31be0a4b54b976555",

}
```

If you want to cancel subscription, consider sending 👇, while replacing `<from-address>` & `<to-address>` with specific addresses you used when subscribing.

```json
{
    "name": "transaction/<from-address>/<to-address>",
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

You'll receive 👇 response, confirming unsubscription

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Unsubscribed from `transaction`"
}
```

### Real-time notification for events 📧

For listening to any events getting emitted by smart contracts deployed on network, you need to send 👇 JSON encoded payload to `/v1/ws` endpoint, after connecting over websocket

```json
{
    "name": "event/<contract-address>/<topic-0-signature>/<topic-1-signature>/<topic-2-signature>/<topic-3-signature>",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

**Here we've some examples :**

- Any event emitted by any smart contract in network

```json
{
    "name": "event/*/*/*/*/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

- Any event emitted by one specific smart contract

```json
{
    "name": "event/0xcb3fA413B23b12E402Cfcd8FA120f983FB70d8E8/*/*/*/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

- Specific event emitted by one specific smart contract

```json
{
    "name": "event/0xcb3fA413B23b12E402Cfcd8FA120f983FB70d8E8/0x2ab93f65628379309f36cb125e90d7c902454a545c4f8b8cb0794af75c24b807/*/*/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

- Specific event emitted by any smart contract in network

```json
{
    "name": "event/*/0xddf252ad1be2c89b69c2b068fc378daa952ba7f163c4a11628f55a4df523b3ef/*/*/*",
    "type": "subscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

> Sample code can be found [here](example/event_1.js)

If everything goes fine, your subscription will be confirmed with 👇 JSON encoded response

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Subscribed to `event`"
}
```

After that as long as your machine is reachable, `ette` will keep notifying you about every event emitted by smart contracts, to which you've subscribed to, in 👇 format

```json
{
  "origin": "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000001010",
  "index": 3,
  "topics": [

}
```

If you want to cancel subscription, consider sending 👇, while replacing `<contract-address>`, `<topic-{0,1,2,3}-signature>` with specific values you used when subscribing.

```json
{
    "name": "event/<contract-address>/<topic-0-signature>/<topic-1-signature>/<topic-2-signature>/<topic-3-signature>",
    "type": "unsubscribe",
    "apiKey": "0x..."
}
```

You'll receive 👇 response, confirming unsubscription

```json
{
    "code": 1,
    "message": "Unsubscribed from `event`"
}
```

> Note: If graceful unsubscription not done, when `ette` finds client unreachable, it'll remove client subscription
